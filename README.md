# weather-app

To design a weather Dashboard that displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for a city the user inputs into the search box. The search is saved and . UV Index changes color depending on weather conditions.

I had a lot of trouble with the weather app. Setting up HTML was relatively easy. Setting up search history was also ok. However, I had trouble appending my weather data to the page. I keep getting a CORS policy error, and I can't figure out how to fix it. The query URLs are correct, and going to the URL shows me the information I need.
